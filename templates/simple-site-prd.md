#### Update Testing Requirements
- [ ] Create feature branch for dependency updates
- [ ] Clear caches: `rm -rf .next && rm -rf node_modules`
- [ ] Test all core functionality
- [ ] Verify build process completes
- [ ] Check TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Run performance audit
- [ ] Document any issues in DEPENDENCY_STRATEGY.md

## ðŸ¤– Agent Coordination Strategy

### Project Tier Assessment
**Tier**: 1 - Simple Site
**Complexity**: Marketing sites, portfolios, blogs
**Agent Team**: Streamlined team for speed with stability

### Agent Team Assignment

**Core Agents for This Tier:**
- `frontend-ux-specialist` - Responsive design and UX implementation
- `dependency-strategist` - Conservative dependency management
- `geek-projects-quality-gate` - Quality standards enforcement
- `epct-orchestrator` - Workflow coordination

### Agent Activation Patterns

**Planning Phase:**
```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive planning for this Tier 1 project"
"Use dependency-strategist to assess technology stack requirements for simple site"
```

**Implementation Phase:**
```bash
"Use frontend-ux-specialist to implement responsive design and user interface"
"Use dependency-strategist for any package decisions"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate each major feature"
```

**Testing & Launch Phase:**
```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive pre-launch validation"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate deployment readiness"
```
