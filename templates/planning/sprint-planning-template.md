# Sprint Planning Template - Enhanced Geek Projects Methodology v4.1+

## Sprint Overview
**Project**: [PROJECT_NAME]
**Project Tier**: [1: Simple Site | 2: Interactive App | 3: SaaS Application]
**Sprint Number**: [X] of [TOTAL_SPRINTS]
**Sprint Duration**: [1-2 weeks based on tier complexity]
**Sprint Goal**: **ONE FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION**

## Single Feature Focus Rule
**CRITICAL**: This sprint implements exactly ONE feature according to its detailed specification.
- ✅ **DO**: Focus exclusively on the planned feature
- ❌ **DON'T**: Add scope creep or "quick additions"
- ✅ **DO**: Complete feature to 100% specification compliance
- ❌ **DON'T**: Leave partial implementations

## Feature Specification Reference
**Feature Name**: [SPECIFIC_FEATURE_NAME]
**Specification Document**: [Link to detailed feature spec in planning-docs/]
**Wireframes/Designs**: [Link to design documents]
**Acceptance Criteria**: [Link to specific success criteria]

### Feature Requirements Summary

## Sprint Execution Plan
**Implementation Approach**: Systematic development with client checkpoint approval

### Day-by-Day Breakdown
**Days 1-2**: Feature foundation and core implementation
- Setup and initial development
- Core functionality implementation
- Basic testing and validation

**Days 3-4**: Feature completion and refinement
- Complete all acceptance criteria
- Cross-browser/device testing
- Performance optimization

**Days 5-6**: Quality assurance and client preparation
- Final testing and polish
- Client demonstration preparation
- Documentation updates

**Day 7**: Client checkpoint and approval
- Feature demonstration to stakeholder
- Feedback collection and approval
- Next sprint planning if approved

## Risk Management
**Potential Technical Risks**:
- [Identify specific implementation challenges]
- [Dependencies on external services]
- [Browser/device compatibility issues]

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- [Backup approaches for technical challenges]
- [Fallback plans for external dependencies]
- [Testing strategy for compatibility]

**Escalation Protocol**:
- Day 3: Alert if behind schedule
- Day 5: Escalate if major issues discovered
- Any time: Involve additional agents if needed

## Quality Gates
**Feature must meet ALL criteria before client checkpoint**:

### Functional Quality
- [ ] Feature works exactly as specified
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] No bugs or unexpected behavior
- [ ] User experience is intuitive and professional

### Technical Quality  
- [ ] Code follows project standards and conventions
- [ ] Performance requirements met (loading time, responsiveness)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Mobile responsive design working correctly

### Business Quality
- [ ] Feature aligns with business requirements
- [ ] Professional appearance matches brand guidelines
- [ ] Ready for stakeholder demonstration
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately

## Client Checkpoint Preparation
**Demo Focus**: [Key aspects to highlight during client review]
**Testing Instructions**: [How client can test the implemented feature]
**Success Criteria**: [What constitutes approval vs. revision needed]

### Checkpoint Agenda
1. **Demo** (10 minutes): Show completed feature functionality
2. **Testing** (5 minutes): Client tests feature hands-on
3. **Feedback** (10 minutes): Collect approval or change requests
4. **Next Steps** (5 minutes): Plan next sprint or revisions

## Definition of Sprint Success
- [ ] **Feature Complete**: Works exactly as specified, no exceptions
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: Meets all technical and business requirements
- [ ] **Client Approval**: Stakeholder approves feature without major revisions
- [ ] **Timeline Adherence**: Sprint completed on schedule
- [ ] **Ready for Next**: No blocking dependencies for subsequent sprints
- [ ] **Documentation Current**: All project docs updated appropriately

## Post-Sprint Actions
- [ ] Update project timeline with completed feature
- [ ] Record client feedback and any approved modifications
- [ ] Plan next sprint based on project roadmap priority
- [ ] Update methodology compliance tracking
- [ ] Archive sprint documentation
