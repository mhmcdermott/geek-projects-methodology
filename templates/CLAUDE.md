```

### Universal Critical Avoidance List
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Beta - causes build failures across all tiers
- **Beta/pre-release packages**: Never use without extensive testing
- **Unvetted React 19 libraries**: Compatibility varies by tier
- **Experimental features**: Wait for stable release
- **Version mismatches**: Always check compatibility matrix

### Dependency Health Monitoring
- **Security audits**: Weekly via `npm audit`
- **Update testing**: All changes tested in feature branches
- **Rollback procedures**: Documented in troubleshooting section

## Build Troubleshooting Protocol
*Standard operating procedure - test proven*

### Module Resolution Errors (98% Success Rate)
1. **ALWAYS** clear Next.js cache first: `rm -rf .next`
2. Clear node_modules if needed: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check for peer dependency warnings in install output
4. Verify TypeScript configuration compatibility
5. Use code-analyzer-debugger agent for complex issues

### Version Conflicts
1. Use dependency-strategist for conflict analysis
2. Review package-lock.json for duplicate packages
3. Check for beta version incompatibilities (especially Tailwind v4)
4. Use `npm ls` to identify conflict sources
5. Document resolution below

### Systematic Troubleshooting Protocol v4.1+
For ANY build issues, follow this exact sequence:

```bash
# Step 1: Clear Next.js cache (fixes 90% of issues)  
rm -rf .next

# Step 2: Reinstall dependencies if needed
npm install

# Step 3: If still failing, nuclear option
rm -rf node_modules && npm install

# Step 4: Check for peer dependency warnings
npm ls

# Step 5: Verify TypeScript configuration compatibility
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Always start with `rm -rf .next` - this is based on real project experience and prevents wasted debugging time.**
