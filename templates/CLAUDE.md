# [PROJECT_NAME] - Development Guide

## Project Classification
**Tier**: [Simple Site | Interactive App | SaaS Application]
**Agent Team**: [Auto-populated based on tier]

## Agent Configurations

### Primary Development Agents
<!-- Tier 1: Simple Site -->
- **frontend-ux-specialist**: UI/UX development and accessibility
- **dependency-strategist**: Conservative dependency management (ALWAYS included)
- **geek-projects-quality-gate**: Quality standards enforcement

<!-- Tier 2: Interactive App - Add these -->
- **systems-architect**: Database design and API structure
- **backend-reliability-engineer**: Server-side implementation
- **security-threat-analyst**: Authentication and security
- **qa-test-engineer**: Testing strategies

<!-- Tier 3: SaaS Application - Add these -->
- **product-manager-orchestrator**: Enterprise coordination
- **performance-optimizer**: Scalability and monitoring
- **code-analyzer-debugger**: Complex debugging

### Agent Coordination Rules
- **Build issues**: code-analyzer-debugger → dependency-strategist
- **Security concerns**: security-threat-analyst → dependency-strategist  
- **Performance problems**: performance-optimizer → dependency-strategist
- **Project decisions**: epct-orchestrator coordinates all agents

## Dependency Strategy
*Generated by dependency-strategist*

### Current Stable Versions (Updated: [DATE])
```json
{
  "react": "19.1.1",
  "react-dom": "19.1.1",
  "@types/react": "^19.0.2",
  "@types/react-dom": "^19.0.2",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
  "next": "^15.1.4",
  "typescript": "^5.7.3"
}
```

### Known Problematic Dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Currently in beta with breaking changes - stay on v3.x
- **React Router**: Can conflict with Next.js App Router - use Next.js routing
- **Moment.js**: Deprecated - use date-fns or native Intl.DateTimeFormat

### Dependency Update Process
1. **Security patches**: Apply immediately after CI testing passes
2. **Minor updates**: Test in feature branch first
3. **Major updates**: Manual review and comprehensive testing
4. **Framework updates**: Coordinate with systems-architect

### Build Troubleshooting
If encountering module resolution or build errors:
1. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
2. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check for peer dependency warnings
4. Verify TypeScript configuration compatibility
5. Consult dependency-strategist for package conflicts

## Development Standards

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Authentication implemented (NextAuth.js with Google OAuth)
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] API routes protected with proper authentication
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured

### Performance Standards
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90 across all metrics
- [ ] Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] Images optimized with next/image
- [ ] Code splitting implemented
- [ ] Bundle size monitored

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] ESLint configuration applied
- [ ] Component structure follows methodology patterns
- [ ] Proper error handling throughout
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All agents have validated their domains
- [ ] Security audit passed (security-threat-analyst)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (performance-optimizer)
- [ ] Dependency health verified (dependency-strategist)
- [ ] Quality standards compliance (geek-projects-quality-gate)

### Agent Validation Commands
```bash
# Project assessment
"Use epct-orchestrator to validate project readiness"

# Security validation
"Use security-threat-analyst to audit security implementation"

# Performance check
"Use performance-optimizer to verify Core Web Vitals"

# Dependency audit
"Use dependency-strategist to check for vulnerabilities"

# Final quality gate
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate for deployment validation"
```

## Project-Specific Guidelines
[Add any project-specific configurations, API keys setup, or special instructions]

## Emergency Procedures

### Build Failure Recovery
1. Activate code-analyzer-debugger for systematic diagnosis
2. Apply cache clearing procedures
3. Check dependency-strategist for version conflicts
4. Test in clean environment
5. Document resolution in DEPENDENCY_STRATEGY.md

### Security Incident Response
1. Immediately activate security-threat-analyst
2. Assess vulnerability with dependency-strategist
3. Apply patches and update dependencies
4. Document incident and prevention measures

### Performance Degradation
1. Use performance-optimizer for bottleneck identification
2. Check dependency impact with dependency-strategist
3. Implement optimizations with validation
4. Monitor production metrics
