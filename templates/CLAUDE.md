{
  "@astrojs/starlight": "^0.28.0",
  "astro": "^5.1.1",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
  "typescript": "^5.7.3"
}
```

}
```

### Universal Critical Avoidance List
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Beta - causes build failures across all tiers
- **Beta/pre-release packages**: Never use without extensive testing
- **Unvetted React 19 libraries**: Compatibility varies by tier
- **Experimental features**: Wait for stable release
- **Version mismatches**: Always check compatibility matrix

### Dependency Health Monitoring
- **Security audits**: Weekly via `npm audit`
- **Update testing**: All changes tested in feature branches
- **Rollback procedures**: Documented in troubleshooting section

## Build Troubleshooting Protocol
*Standard operating procedure - test proven*

### Module Resolution Errors (98% Success Rate)
1. **ALWAYS** clear Next.js cache first: `rm -rf .next`
2. Clear node_modules if needed: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check for peer dependency warnings in install output
4. Verify TypeScript configuration compatibility
5. Use code-analyzer-debugger agent for complex issues

### Version Conflicts
1. Use dependency-strategist for conflict analysis
2. Review package-lock.json for duplicate packages
3. Check for beta version incompatibilities (especially Tailwind v4)
4. Use `npm ls` to identify conflict sources
5. Document resolution below

### Systematic Troubleshooting Protocol v4.1+
For ANY build issues, follow this exact sequence:

```bash
# Step 1: Clear Next.js cache (fixes 90% of issues)  
rm -rf .next

# Step 2: Reinstall dependencies if needed
npm install

# Step 3: If still failing, nuclear option
rm -rf node_modules && npm install

# Step 4: Check for peer dependency warnings
npm ls

# Step 5: Verify TypeScript configuration compatibility
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Always start with `rm -rf .next` - this is based on real project experience and prevents wasted debugging time.**

## Sprint-Based Development Approach v4.1+

### Development Focus
- **Work on ONE sprint at a time** according to Current Sprint specifications
- **Reference sprint acceptance criteria** before implementing features
- **Update progress systematically** in project documentation
- **Prepare for client checkpoints** at sprint completion

### Sprint Completion Checklist
- [ ] All sprint acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code quality maintained with proper documentation
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for tier
- [ ] Testing completed across required devices/browsers
- [ ] Client checkpoint materials prepared
- [ ] Ready for stakeholder review and approval

### Enhanced Sprint Structure v4.1+

**⚠️ CRITICAL METHODOLOGY ENHANCEMENT**: Client Review Phase Mandatory

For projects approaching final development phases, implement **Sprint X.5: Client Review & Content Refinement** as a mandatory phase between feature completion and quality assurance.

#### Sprint X.5: Client Review & Content Refinement (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Ensure client approval before quality assurance phase
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks (depending on project tier)
**Critical Rule**: Never proceed to QA without formal client approval

##### Client Review Process
- [ ] Comprehensive site/application walkthrough with all stakeholders
- [ ] Content validation (copy, messaging, tone, accuracy)
- [ ] Visual refinement feedback (layout, spacing, components, branding)
- [ ] Brand alignment validation (colors, typography, visual hierarchy)
- [ ] User experience review (navigation, CTAs, mobile responsiveness)
- [ ] Business logic validation (services, pricing, process flows)

##### Refinement Implementation
- [ ] Content adjustments based on client feedback
- [ ] Layout modifications for improved visual hierarchy
- [ ] Brand fine-tuning and messaging optimization
- [ ] UX enhancements and interaction improvements
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness refinements
- [ ] Performance optimizations based on usage patterns

##### Client Approval Checkpoint
- [ ] Formal written sign-off on final content and design
- [ ] Change lock implementation (no further content changes)
- [ ] QA authorization (client approval required before quality gates)
- [ ] Final scope confirmation and acceptance

**🚨 MANDATORY**: Only proceed to quality assurance after formal client approval

### Client Checkpoint Process
1. **Sprint Review**: Present completed sprint deliverables
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather stakeholder input and approval
3. **Client Review Phase**: Implement Sprint X.5 for final projects
4. **Approval Workflow**: Pending → Client Review → Approved → QA Phase
5. **Satisfaction Tracking**: Collect ratings and success metrics

### Professional Communication
- Transparent progress updates throughout development
- Clear explanation of technical decisions and trade-offs
- Systematic documentation of client feedback and changes
- Professional presentation of deliverables and milestones
