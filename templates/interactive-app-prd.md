## ðŸ¤– Agent Coordination Strategy

### Project Tier Assessment
**Tier**: 2 - Interactive App
**Complexity**: Dashboards, tools, user applications
**Agent Team**: Comprehensive team for complex features

### Agent Team Assignment

**Core Agents for This Tier:**
- `systems-architect` - Database design and API structure
- `security-threat-analyst` - Authentication and security
- `backend-reliability-engineer` - Server-side systems
- `frontend-ux-specialist` - Interactive UI components
- `performance-optimizer` - Speed optimization
- `dependency-strategist` - Package compatibility
- `qa-test-engineer` - Testing strategies
- `geek-projects-quality-gate` - Quality enforcement
- `epct-orchestrator` - Workflow coordination

### Agent Activation Patterns

**Planning Phase:**
```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive planning for this Tier 2 project"
"Use systems-architect to plan technical architecture and database design"
"Use security-threat-analyst to identify security requirements"
"Use dependency-strategist to assess technology stack requirements"
```

**Implementation Phase:**
```bash
"Use systems-architect to implement database structure and API design"
"Use security-threat-analyst to implement authentication and input validation"
"Use backend-reliability-engineer to implement server-side logic"
"Use frontend-ux-specialist to implement interactive user interface"
"Use performance-optimizer to optimize application performance"
"Use dependency-strategist for any package decisions"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate each major feature"
```

**Testing & Launch Phase:**
```bash
"Use qa-test-engineer to implement comprehensive testing strategy"
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive pre-launch validation"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate deployment readiness"
```
