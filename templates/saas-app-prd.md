## ðŸ¤– Agent Coordination Strategy

### Project Tier Assessment
**Tier**: 3 - SaaS Application
**Complexity**: Complex business applications, enterprise tools
**Agent Team**: Enterprise coordination for large projects

### Agent Team Assignment

**Core Agents for This Tier:**
- `product-manager-orchestrator` - Multi-agent coordination for enterprise complexity
- `systems-architect` - Database design and API structure
- `security-threat-analyst` - Authentication and security
- `backend-reliability-engineer` - Server-side systems
- `frontend-ux-specialist` - Interactive UI components
- `performance-optimizer` - Speed optimization
- `dependency-strategist` - Package compatibility
- `qa-test-engineer` - Testing strategies
- `geek-projects-quality-gate` - Quality enforcement
- Additional specialists as needed

### Agent Activation Patterns

**Planning Phase:**
```bash
"Use product-manager-orchestrator to coordinate enterprise-level planning for this Tier 3 project"
"Use systems-architect to plan scalable technical architecture and database design"
"Use security-threat-analyst to identify comprehensive security requirements"
"Use dependency-strategist to assess enterprise technology stack requirements"
```

**Implementation Phase:**
```bash
"Use product-manager-orchestrator to coordinate multi-agent development teams"
"Use systems-architect to implement scalable database structure and API design"
"Use security-threat-analyst to implement enterprise-grade authentication and security"
"Use backend-reliability-engineer to implement reliable server-side systems"
"Use frontend-ux-specialist to implement complex user interfaces"
"Use performance-optimizer to optimize application performance and scalability"
"Use dependency-strategist for any package decisions"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate each major feature"
```

**Testing & Launch Phase:**
```bash
"Use qa-test-engineer to implement comprehensive testing including load testing"
"Use product-manager-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive pre-launch validation"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate enterprise deployment readiness"
```
