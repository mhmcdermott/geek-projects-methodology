# Agent Quick Reference

## ðŸ¤– Core Agents

### dependency-strategist
**Purpose**: Conservative dependency management expert
**Use for**: Package evaluation, security audits, build troubleshooting

**Common Commands:**
```bash
"Use dependency-strategist to evaluate adding [package-name]"
"Use dependency-strategist to audit current dependency security"
"Use dependency-strategist to investigate build failure"
"Use dependency-strategist to check for dependency conflicts"
```

### epct-orchestrator
**Purpose**: E.P.C.T. workflow coordination and agent selection
**Use for**: Project assessment, workflow coordination, phase transitions

**Common Commands:**
```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to assess and classify this project"
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate [feature] implementation"
"Use epct-orchestrator to transition from [current phase] to [next phase]"
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive planning"
```

### geek-projects-quality-gate
**Purpose**: Quality standards enforcement and validation
**Use for**: Quality validation, pre-deployment checks, standards compliance

**Common Commands:**
```bash
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate before deployment"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to enforce security standards"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate feature implementation"
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to check quality compliance"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Selection by Task Type

### Project Planning
- **Project assessment**: epct-orchestrator
- **Requirements gathering**: prd-writer + epct-orchestrator
- **Technology evaluation**: dependency-strategist

### Development Work
- **Frontend features**: frontend-ux-specialist
- **Backend development**: backend-reliability-engineer
- **Security implementation**: security-threat-analyst
- **Performance optimization**: performance-optimizer
- **Dependency management**: dependency-strategist

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing strategy**: qa-test-engineer
- **Security audit**: security-threat-analyst
- **Performance validation**: performance-optimizer
- **Overall quality**: geek-projects-quality-gate

### Problem Resolution
- **Build failures**: dependency-strategist + code-analyzer-debugger
- **Security issues**: security-threat-analyst
- **Performance problems**: performance-optimizer
- **Quality failures**: geek-projects-quality-gate

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedures

### Build Completely Broken
```bash
"Use dependency-strategist to investigate build failure and check for dependency conflicts"
"Use code-analyzer-debugger to systematically analyze the error"
```

### Security Vulnerability Discovered
```bash
"Use security-threat-analyst to assess vulnerability impact"
"Use dependency-strategist to identify affected packages"
```

### Performance Regression
```bash
"Use performance-optimizer to identify performance bottlenecks"
"Use dependency-strategist to assess dependency impact on performance"
```

## ðŸ“‹ Agent Workflow Patterns

### Starting New Project
```bash
1. "Use epct-orchestrator to assess and classify this [project description] project"
2. "Use dependency-strategist to assess technology stack requirements"
3. "Use [tier-appropriate agents] to plan implementation"
```

### Feature Development
```bash
1. "Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate [feature] implementation"
2. "Use [specialist agent] to implement [specific aspect]"
3. "Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate implementation"
```

### Pre-Deployment
```bash
1. "Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive pre-launch validation"
2. "Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate deployment readiness"
3. "Use dependency-strategist to conduct final security audit"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Tier-Specific Agent Teams

### Tier 1 (Simple Sites)
- Primary: frontend-ux-specialist, dependency-strategist
- Coordinator: epct-orchestrator
- Validation: geek-projects-quality-gate

### Tier 2 (Interactive Apps)
- Architecture: systems-architect
- Security: security-threat-analyst
- Backend: backend-reliability-engineer
- Frontend: frontend-ux-specialist
- Performance: performance-optimizer
- Dependencies: dependency-strategist
- Testing: qa-test-engineer
- Validation: geek-projects-quality-gate

### Tier 3 (SaaS Applications)
- Orchestration: product-manager-orchestrator
- All Tier 2 agents plus additional specialists as needed

Remember: Agents provide expert guidance while you maintain control over implementation decisions. Use them to enhance your methodology, not replace your judgment.
