## Agent Selection Logic
When user requests feature work:
1. Assess project tier from CLAUDE.md
2. Identify current E.P.C.T. phase

4. Coordinate handoffs between phases
5. Ensure dependency strategy compliance throughout

Always start with tier assessment and phase identification before agent selection.
