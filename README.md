# Enhanced Geek Projects Methodology - Agent-Integrated Workflow

## ðŸ¤– Prerequisites: Agent System Setup

**Before starting any project, ensure you have the agent system installed:**

### 1. Install Core Methodology Agents
```bash
# Copy agents to Claude Code directory
cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/agents/
# Should show: dependency-strategist.md, epct-orchestrator.md, geek-projects-quality-gate.md
```

### 2. Install Enhanced E.P.C.T. Commands
```bash
# Copy enhanced commands
cp templates/enhanced/epct-workflow.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/commands/
# Should show: epct-workflow.md
```

### 3. Agent System Verification
Test in Claude Code with any project:
```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to assess the agent system installation"
```

## ðŸš€ Enhanced Project Workflow

### Phase 1: Agent-Coordinated Planning (Claude Chat)

#### Step 1: Agent-Enhanced Project Assessment
**Replace traditional manual assessment with agent coordination:**

```bash
# Instead of manual classification, use:
"Use epct-orchestrator to assess and classify this [project description] project"
```

**Agent will automatically:**
- Determine project tier (Simple Site / Interactive App / SaaS Application)
- Recommend appropriate agent team for the tier
- Estimate timeline and complexity
- Identify key technical challenges

#### Step 2: Agent-Assisted PRD Creation
**Enhanced PRD creation with specialist guidance:**

1. **Copy appropriate PRD template** from `/templates/`
2. **Use agent assistance for comprehensive requirements:**
```bash
"Use prd-writer to enhance and structure these project requirements"
"Use dependency-strategist to assess technology stack requirements for this tier"
```

**For Tier 2/3 projects, also use:**
```bash
"Use security-threat-analyst to identify security requirements"
"Use systems-architect to plan technical architecture"
```

#### Step 3: Agent-Coordinated Task Breakdown
**Systematic task planning with expert coordination:**

```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive task breakdown and planning"
```

**Agent will coordinate:**
- Technical architecture planning (systems-architect)
- Security planning (security-threat-analyst for Tier 2/3)
- Dependency strategy (dependency-strategist)
- Implementation timeline and phases

### Phase 2: Agent-Enhanced Technical Setup (Claude Code)

#### Step 4: Agent-Coordinated Repository Setup
**Enhanced repository creation with agent validation:**

```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate repository setup for this [Tier] project"
```

**Agent-enhanced setup includes:**
1. **Repository creation** with agent-validated structure
2. **Enhanced CLAUDE.md** with agent configuration from `/templates/enhanced/`
3. **DEPENDENCY_STRATEGY.md** configured by dependency-strategist
4. **CI/CD pipelines** with conservative dependency testing

#### Step 5: Agent-Validated Development Environment
**Environment setup with expert oversight:**

```bash
"Use dependency-strategist to validate and configure development environment"
```

**Includes:**
- Conservative dependency installation with pinned versions
- Security-validated environment variables
- Agent-approved development configuration
- Build verification with troubleshooting procedures

### Phase 3: Agent-Specialized Development (Claude Code)

#### Step 6: Feature Development with Agent Coordination
**For each feature, use specialist agents:**

**Frontend Work:**
```bash
"Use frontend-ux-specialist to implement [responsive navigation/dashboard/user interface]"
```

**Backend Work:**
```bash
"Use backend-reliability-engineer to implement [API endpoints/database/authentication]"
```

**Security Implementation:**
```bash
"Use security-threat-analyst to implement [authentication/input validation/security headers]"
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```bash
"Use performance-optimizer to optimize [page speed/bundle size/Core Web Vitals]"
```

**Dependency Management:**
```bash
"Use dependency-strategist to [evaluate packages/audit security/manage updates]"
```

#### Step 7: Continuous Quality Gates
**After each major feature:**
```bash
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate feature implementation"
```

**Agent will coordinate:**
- Security validation (security-threat-analyst)
- Performance validation (performance-optimizer)
- Dependency health check (dependency-strategist)
- Code quality review

### Phase 4: Agent-Validated Launch (Claude Chat + Code)

#### Step 8: Comprehensive Pre-Launch Validation
**Multi-agent final review:**

```bash
"Use epct-orchestrator to coordinate comprehensive pre-launch validation"
```

**Includes:**
- Complete security audit (security-threat-analyst)
- Performance benchmark validation (performance-optimizer)
- Dependency security final check (dependency-strategist)
- Quality standards compliance (geek-projects-quality-gate)

#### Step 9: Agent-Monitored Deployment
**Deployment with agent oversight:**

```bash
"Use geek-projects-quality-gate to validate deployment readiness"
```

**Agent ensures:**
- All quality gates passed
- Security configuration verified
- Performance monitoring setup
- Dependency monitoring active

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Team Configurations
