## Start Here

### 1. Copy the starter
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhmcdermott/geek-projects-methodology.git
cp -r geek-projects-methodology/starter my-project
cd my-project
npm install && npm run dev
```

### 2. Read QUICK-START.md
Open **[QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md)** - pick your tier, follow the checklist.

### 3. For features, use the workflow
```
/epct-workflow
```
This enforces planning before coding.

## That's it.

Everything else is reference material:

| File | Use when... |
|------|-------------|
| [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md) | Starting a project |
| [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) | You need stack/pattern details |
| [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) | You need daily process reference |
| [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) | You're about to ship |

## Stack

```
Next.js 16.x + React 19.x + Tailwind 4.x + TypeScript 5.x
```
